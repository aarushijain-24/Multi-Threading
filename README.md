# Matrix Multiplication with Multithreading
This repository contains Python code to perform matrix multiplication using multithreading. The program explores the performance impact of utilizing multiple threads on CPU-bound tasks such as matrix multiplication.

## Overview
Matrix multiplication is a computationally intensive task, particularly for large matrices. By leveraging multithreading, it's possible to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores, potentially speeding up the computation.

## Features
1. Multithreading: Utilizes Python's threading module to perform matrix multiplication concurrently on multiple threads.
2. Performance Analysis: Measures and compares the execution time for different numbers of threads.
3. Visualization: Includes a graphical representation of execution time versus the number of threads using matplotlib.

# Results
The program will output the execution time for different numbers of threads, demonstrating the impact of multithreading on performance.
